We simulate a **retrieval-augmented generation system** that, given a query, performs the following steps: 
1. retrieves passages and identifies the information nuggets in the top retrieved results containing key pieces of information answering a user query; 
2. synthesizes the identified snippets (i.e., information nuggets) into a concise and natural language response;
3. returns the systemâ€™s confidence in the provided response; and based on the provided query, retrieved information nuggets, and returned confidence,
4. identifies the potential pitfalls and limitations that could have contributed to flaws in the response.

This hypothetical system would return a response that includes explanations to help the user assess the response quality. We consider three types of explanations the system provides to enhance its response: 
1. the **system response source**, to help users verify the response's factual correctness and broader context; 
2. the **system confidence** in the provided response, to give users insights about how certain the outcome of response generation is; and
3. potential **limitations or pitfalls** to warn the user about flaws in the response or the source.
