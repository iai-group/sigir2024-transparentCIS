It was created by millions of years of wind and water erosion from the Colorado River, which cut through layer after layer of sediment.  The rocks of the canyon walls range from 250 million years old at the top to over 2 billion years old at the bottom.  Each layer of rock represents a distinct geological period of the Earth \'s past.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Seven Natural Wonders - Paricutin Volcano</span> Paricutin Volcano erupted out of a cornfield on February 20, 1943.  Located just outside a city called Michoacan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, Paricutin grew to 10,400 feet in just nine years, making it the fastest growing volcano ever recorded in history.  Lava flows destroyed two villages and hundreds of homes, but caused no fatalities (although three people died from lightning associated with the eruption).', 'Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called \'highly climate vulnerable\'.

In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \'forced riders\' as opposed to the \'free riders\' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.

Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.

Learn more about these amazing natural wonders!  Seven Natural Wonders - Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is a rocky gorge (ravine) in Arizona, USA.  It was created by millions of years of wind and water erosion from the Colorado River, which cut through layer after layer of sediment.  The rocks of the canyon walls range from 250 million years old at the top to over 2 billion years old at the bottom.  Each layer of rock represents a distinct geological period of the Earth \'s past.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Seven Natural Wonders - Paricutin Volcano</span> Paricutin Volcano erupted out of a cornfield on February 20, 1943.  Located just outside a city called Michoacan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, Paricutin grew to 10,400 feet in just nine years, making it the fastest growing volcano ever recorded in history.

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \'forced riders\' as opposed to the \'free riders\' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.</span>  These effects are most severe for the world\'s poorest countries.

Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.  These conflicts that teens deal with throughout the social media world can create a massive amount of depression as teens struggle to be socially “accepted.”</span>  These effects of depression lead to teens having severe insecurities, which then concludes that social networking degrades teens.

Learn more about these amazing natural wonders!  Seven Natural Wonders - Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is a rocky gorge (ravine) in Arizona, USA.  It was created by millions of years of wind and water erosion from the Colorado River, which cut through layer after layer of sediment.  The rocks of the canyon walls range from 250 million years old at the top to over 2 billion years old at the bottom.  Each layer of rock represents a distinct geological period of the Earth \'s past.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Seven Natural Wonders - Paricutin Volcano</span> Paricutin Volcano erupted out of a cornfield on February 20, 1943.  Located just outside a city called Michoacan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, Paricutin grew to 10,400 feet in just nine years, making it the fastest growing volcano ever recorded in history.  Lava flows destroyed two villages and hundreds of homes, but caused no fatalities (although three people died from lightning associated with the eruption).', 'Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called \'highly climate vulnerable\'. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \'forced riders\' as opposed to the \'free riders\' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.</span>  These effects are most severe for the world\'s poorest countries.

Teens that want these so called causes can be pushed to become unsure of who they are and who they want to become.  Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.  These conflicts that teens deal with throughout the social media world can create a massive amount of depression as teens struggle to be socially “accepted.”</span>  These effects of depression lead to teens having severe insecurities, which then concludes that social networking degrades teens.

Learn more about these amazing natural wonders!  Seven Natural Wonders - Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is a rocky gorge (ravine) in Arizona, USA.  It was created by millions of years of wind and water erosion from the Colorado River, which cut through layer after layer of sediment.  The rocks of the canyon walls range from 250 million years old at the top to over 2 billion years old at the bottom.  Each layer of rock represents a distinct geological period of the Earth \'s past.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Seven Natural Wonders - Paricutin Volcano</span> Paricutin Volcano erupted out of a cornfield on February 20, 1943.  Located just outside a city called Michoacan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, Paricutin grew to 10,400 feet in just nine years, making it the fastest growing volcano ever recorded in history.  Lava flows destroyed two villages and hundreds of homes, but caused no fatalities (although three people died from lightning associated with the eruption).', 'Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called \'highly climate vulnerable\'. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \'forced riders\' as opposed to the \'free riders\' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.</span>  These effects are most severe for the world\'s poorest countries.

Teens that want these so called causes can be pushed to become unsure of who they are and who they want to become.  Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.  These conflicts that teens deal with throughout the social media world can create a massive amount of depression as teens struggle to be socially “accepted.”</span>  These effects of depression lead to teens having severe insecurities, which then concludes that social networking degrades teens.

Learn more about these amazing natural wonders!  Seven Natural Wonders - Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is a rocky gorge (ravine) in Arizona, USA.  It was created by millions of years of wind and water erosion from the Colorado River, which cut through layer after layer of sediment.  The rocks of the canyon walls range from 250 million years old at the top to over 2 billion years old at the bottom.  Each layer of rock represents a distinct geological period of the Earth \'s past.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Seven Natural Wonders - Paricutin Volcano</span> Paricutin Volcano erupted out of a cornfield on February 20, 1943.  Located just outside a city called Michoacan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, Paricutin grew to 10,400 feet in just nine years, making it the fastest growing volcano ever recorded in history.  Lava flows destroyed two villages and hundreds of homes, but caused no fatalities (although three people died from lightning associated with the eruption).', 'Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called \'highly climate vulnerable\'. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \'forced riders\' as opposed to the \'free riders\' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  <span style=""background-color: powderblue"">Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.</span>  These effects are most severe for the world\'s poorest countries.

Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.  These conflicts that teens deal with throughout the social media world can create a massive amount of depression as teens struggle to be socially “accepted.”</span>  These effects of depression lead to teens having severe insecurities, which then concludes that social networking degrades teens.
