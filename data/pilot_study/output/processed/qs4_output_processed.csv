7,9,That’s interesting. Tell me more about how climate change affects developing countries.,"Climate change profoundly affects the health of people in developing countries, particularly the world's poorest nations. The Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports estimate that climate change causes around 400,000 deaths annually in these regions, with a significant impact on health primarily due to hunger and communicable diseases.
