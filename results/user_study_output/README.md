# User Study Output

This directory contains data collected in our study. Raw output from Amazon Mechanical Turk aggregated for all the HITs can be found [here](mturk_output.csv). Processed data can be found [here](output_processed.csv) and data presented on response instead of HIT level can be found [here](output_processed_aggregated.csv).

We used [this script](../../scripts/results_processing.py) for processing MTurk output and [this](../../scripts/results_aggregation.py) for aggregating the results on response level.
