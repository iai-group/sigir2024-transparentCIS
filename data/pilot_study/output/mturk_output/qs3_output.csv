I think this was due to the complexities of the issues.,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,Confidence of the system is low due to the complexity of the issue but does provide pertinent information that is useful in understanding how complex the issue is.,The response gives a simple psychological problematics in the usage of social sites.,The response was that of gibberish and jargon nothing that was clearly defined.,What was provided was more like a list which could be used as a starting point to gain further information about the different natural wonders.,Basic shallow answer but it does provide a common sense result that might satisfy a user.,The question was not answered directly with a formula in relation to energy expenditure and fat burning ratio.,Shallow response not very detailed. Only presented a name of the opposition of the movement.,Another shallow response more poetic than factual. Not very detailed.,Provides an outline of steps that can be taken to resolve the problem.,Step by step process was given on how to achieve the goal the user was requesting.,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,male,,,The task was a bit long but still enjoyable. thank you,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,Most responses were very basic. I would say they were more of leads to further searches for more in-depth answers to the questions posed.,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,Issues are complex in nature that require more than a generated paragraph to answer completely.,,
