Tell me more about how climate change affects developing countries.,"Climate change profoundly affects the health of people in developing countries, particularly the world's poorest nations. The Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports estimate that climate change causes around 400,000 deaths annually in these regions, with a significant impact on health primarily due to hunger and communicable diseases. Developing countries, with their limited resources and infrastructure, are especially vulnerable to these health-related consequences of climate change, highlighting the pressing need for global climate justice.",EC3,"['Climate change has a severe impact on the health of people in developing countries leading to around 400,000 annual deaths primarily due to hunger and communicable diseases.', 'Climate change exacerbates food insecurity in vulnerable nations, leading to malnutrition and posing additional health risks.', 'Many developing countries are experiencing climate-induced migration as people seek refuge from the impacts of climate change, including droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.']","[1, 0, 0]","['3', '1', '1', '1', '1']","['A2NJ5WO5UCMJMC', 'A2OENJVA78PHTL', 'AQQZ96P85B3B', 'A28G4QO0DRY8OZ', 'A14PFRHG0A2YY9']","['4', '4', '2', '2', '3']","['4', '4', '3', '3', '3']","['4', '3', '3', '3', '3']","['4', '3', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '3', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '4', '3', '3', '2']","['4', '3', '3', '3', '3']","['4', '4', '2', '4', '4']","['4', '3', '3', '1', '3']","['4', '3', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '3', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '4', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '3', '3', '4', '4']","['4', '3', '3', '3', '3']","['4', '4', '3', '4', '3']","['Highly useful.', ""However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the response. 400,000 is an estimated figure, and the actual number of deaths could be higher.
